To ensure that the fridge is designed and constructed in a logical and efficient way, 
a Gantt chart has been produced showing the expected outcomes as the weeks go by (seen in Figure \ref{fig:gantt}). 
Furthermore, figure \ref{fig:risk_management} shows a list of foreseeable risks compared to the values of a risk matrix. 
By following these two guides, a solid proof of concept will be produced by the final presentation and report deadlines.

As for costing, the “Fridge” outer shell we require $2m^2$ of acrylic, approximately £30.
ESP32-Cam costs £11, RPi £32 and Weight Sensor £9 [2][3][4]. Smaller components will be provided by the UG Labs.
