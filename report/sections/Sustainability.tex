The Smart Fridge is designed with the UN's Sustainability Development Goals [1] in mind.
Our first identified UN SDG is goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.
Using the data captured by the Smart Fridge users can prevent food waste either due to overstocking or letting goods expire.
Recipe and nutritional provided via the app or website will also promote better nutrition.
This also aids with UN SDG goal 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages, as nutrition is key to good health.
Our final SDG is goal 12 to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
Food waste is a major source of emissions, and reducing it at the consumer level is a step forward.
Our app can also promote recipes which use ingredients which are more sustainably produced such as plant-based alternatives.
