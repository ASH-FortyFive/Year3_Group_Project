      \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}My aim for this project was to develop my\\ teamwork skills. This was achieved mainly\\ when working on the box design where, \\ throughout the project, it was necessary\\ to listen to the requirements of each team\\ to design a box that best fitted everyone’s\\ needs. \\  \\ With barcode detection my aim was to find\\ and test suitable algorithms in order to\\ select the best one for this product.\end{tabular} \\ \hline

      \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}My goals for this project were to develop my\\ skills, specifically my skills in software and\\ programming. I took responsibility of creating\\ a website. Since I had not previously created\\ a website, there was a lot to learn. Learn how\\ web applications and hardware are integrated \\ I also wanted to gain experience with\\ programming hardware and understand\\ different methods of achieving a software-\\ hardware solution.\end{tabular} \\ \hline

      \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}My goals for this project were to develop my\\ software and team working skills. I was in the\\ software team with the aim of developing a \\ model that would classify the objects, acting\\ as an object recognition system. It was also\\ important for me to improve my teamwork\\ skills especially in software as so far I have\\ been mainly working on my own.\end{tabular} \\ \hline

      \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}My goals for the group project included\\ developing my skills in both the technical\\ and management side. I wanted to take\\ more responsibility for organising the team\\ and architecting the software for the\\ microcontroller. I also aim to be an active\\ team member and contribute resources\\ when required.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
