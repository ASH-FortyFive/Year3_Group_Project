    \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Strengths:\\    \\ - Helps the user  keep track of the \\ products in their  fridge and therefore\\ helps reduce waste.\\ - Helping the  user not buy unnecessary\\ food, which will save them money and \\ make   investing in the product worth it.  \\ - The app  promotes healthy diets which\\ will help the user live a healthier life.\\ - Similar   products require the user to\\ change their daily routine to operate. Our \\ Product is autonomous and doesn't require\\ the user to do anything.\\ - Given that the  prototype can be produced\\ for under Â£100, the additional price increase\\ compared to a  normal fridge is relatively low.\end{tabular} &
      \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Weakness:\\    \\ - Item detection needs to be very accurate \\ so that user doesn't need to manually\\ enter the items.\\ - Similar looking items might confuse the \\ computer vision system.\\ - The product requires the user to own a\\ and want to use smart phone, this might\\ reduce the pool of customers.\end{tabular} \\ \hline

    \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Opportunities:\\  \\ - There are very few similar products on\\ the market. \\ - Most households have fridges. When they\\ are replaced, users are looking for unique\\ selling features. This makes our product very\\ desirable. \\ - Could be sold globally.\end{tabular} &
      \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Threats:\\    \\ - The fridge market is very large therefore\\ it  would be difficult to make this product\\ stand out despite its unique selling feature.\\ - Patents would be required, otherwise \\ better funded companies could outperform \\ the Smart Fridge.\\ - Convincing customers to spend more\\ money on the product than a normal fridge\\ would mean that the benefits would need to\\ be very clear with strong marketing. This\\ would cost significant amounts of money.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
